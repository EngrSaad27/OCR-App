## üåü Project Description
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a widely used technology designed to extract text characters from images and convert them into editable text formats. Beyond text extraction, OCR is also employed for element detection and region-specific cropping within images, making it a versatile tool for document processing and analysis.

Modern OCR systems are tailored to handle various specialized tasks, leveraging advancements in machine learning and computer vision. However, Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have historically lagged in OCR capabilities. Continuous innovations are now bridging this gap, significantly enhancing OCR performance.

The next-generation OCR 2.0 models come with key features that set them apart:

- End-to-End Architecture: Streamlines processes, reducing maintenance overhead.
- Cost Efficiency: Ensures low training and inference costs.
- Versatility: Adaptable to a wide range of applications, making it suitable for diverse use cases.
